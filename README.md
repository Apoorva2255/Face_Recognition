5. Model Evaluation


# 1. Requirements:

Python (>= 3.6)
TensorFlow (>= 2.0)
OpenCV (>= 4.0)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)

# 2. Installation:

# Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/face_recognition_model.git
cd face_recognition_model

# Install the required Python packages using pip:


pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Usage:

# To use the face recognition model, follow these steps:

# For Image Recognition:

python recognize_image.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg

# For Video Stream Recognition:

python recognize_video.py

# 4. Training:

## If you want to train the model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

## Prepare your dataset with images of faces labeled with corresponding identities.

## Adjust the model architecture and parameters in train_model.py as needed.

# Run the training script:

python train_model.py --dataset /path/to/dataset

# 5. Model Evaluation:

# To evaluate the performance of the trained model, you can use the evaluate_model.py script:

python evaluate_model.py --model_path /path/to/model.h5 --test_dataset /path/to/test_dataset
